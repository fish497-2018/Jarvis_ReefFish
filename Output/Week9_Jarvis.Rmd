```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Setup Relevant Data

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
reef_fish <- read.csv("Data/Supplemental201.csv")
```

```{r}
reef_fish_bootless <- select(reef_fish, Genus, species, Bootless, Museum.Bootless, Fished) %>% 
  filter(Bootless > 0 | Museum.Bootless > 0) %>% 
  filter(Bootless < 50)
View(reef_fish_bootless)
```

```{r}
ggplot(reef_fish_bootless_sp) +
  geom_point(aes(x = bootless, y = n_species), color = "blue", size = 3, alpha = 0.4) +
  geom_point(aes(x = Museum.Bootless, y = n_species), color = "red", size = 3, alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(x = "Species Present by Location", y = "Total Species Count")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
