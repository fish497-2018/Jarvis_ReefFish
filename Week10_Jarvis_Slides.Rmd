## Introduction to my Data and Analyses

* The raw data compares the presence and absence of 470 coral reef fish species in 5 dive sites in Papua New Guinea in the 21st century

* There is also presence/absence data for a historical museum collection from one site (Bootless Bay, circa 1881). 

* This analysis examines changes in species richness in Bootless Bay over time, and whether fishing pressure correlates to any changes seen.

## Modifying Raw Data

* I used the filter commmand to filter out rows where species were not present at either location.

* I selected columns with the following data: Genus, species, presence/absence in Bootless Bay (21st century), presence/absence in museum collection (1881-1889), and fishing pressure (fished/not fished).

* I used gather() to establish a location column (categorical, Bootless vs Museum), and catch_code column (0 for absence, 1 for presence) to better organize the data.


```reef_fish_bootless <- select(reef_fish, Genus, species, Bootless, Museum.Bootless, Fished) %>% 
  filter(Bootless > 0 | Museum.Bootless > 0) %>% 
  filter(Bootless < 50) %>% 
  gather(`Museum.Bootless`, `Bootless`, key = "location", value = "catch_code")```

```{r, include=FALSE}
reef_fish_bootless <- select(reef_fish, Genus, species, Bootless, Museum.Bootless, Fished) %>% 
  filter(Bootless > 0 | Museum.Bootless > 0) %>% 
  filter(Bootless < 50) %>% 
  gather(`Museum.Bootless`, `Bootless`, key = "location", value = "catch_code")
```

## Separating by Fishing Pressure

* I made separate data frames for species that were fished and not fished. This would later help me see if fishing pressure had anything to do with what trends might appear.

```reef_fish_bootless_fished <- filter(reef_fish_bootless, Fished == "fished" | Fished == "Fished")```

```reef_fish_bootless_notfished <- filter(reef_fish_bootless, Fished == "not fished")```

```{r, include=FALSE}
reef_fish_bootless_fished <- filter(reef_fish_bootless, Fished == "fished" | Fished == "Fished")

reef_fish_bootless_notfished <- filter(reef_fish_bootless, Fished == "not fished")
```

## Making Useful Tables

* I grouped all the reef fish by genus and location, then summed the species seen per genus at each location in the total_catch column.

```reef_fish_bootless_sp <- group_by(reef_fish_bootless, Genus, location) %>%
  summarize(total_catch = sum(catch_code))```

```{r, include=FALSE}
reef_fish_bootless_sp <- group_by(reef_fish_bootless, Genus, location) %>%
  summarize(total_catch = sum(catch_code))
```

## More Useful Tables

* I repeated this process for the data frames organized by fishing pressure.

```bootless_fished_sp <- group_by(reef_fish_bootless_fished, Genus, location) %>% 
  summarise(total_catch = sum(catch_code))```
    
```bootless_notfished_sp <- group_by(reef_fish_bootless_notfished, Genus, location) %>% 
  summarise(total_catch = sum(catch_code))```

```{r, include=FALSE}
bootless_fished_sp <- group_by(reef_fish_bootless_fished, Genus, location) %>% 
  summarise(total_catch = sum(catch_code))

bootless_notfished_sp <- group_by(reef_fish_bootless_notfished, Genus, location) %>% 
  summarise(total_catch = sum(catch_code))
```

## Graphing Data

* I used ggplot2 to plot a histogram with the species seen per genus on the x-axis and frequency of that count on the y-axis. 

* Colored bars differentiate the locations: counts from the museum collection are in teal, and modern counts from Bootless Bay arer in red.

```ggplot(reef_fish_bootless_sp) +```

  ```geom_histogram(aes(x = total_catch, fill = location), position = "dodge") +```
  
  ```labs(x = "Species per Genus Present by Location", y = "Frequency") +```
  
  ```ggtitle("Species Richness in Bootless Bay Over Time")```
  
## Graph: Species Richness in Bootless Bay Over Time
  
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(reef_fish_bootless_sp) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = total_catch, fill = location), position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Species per Genus Present by Location", y = "Frequency") +
  ggtitle("Species Richness in Bootless Bay Over Time")
```

## Graph: Species Under Fishing Pressure

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(bootless_fished_sp) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = total_catch, fill = location), position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Species per Genus Present by Location", y = "Frequency") +
  ggtitle("Species Richness in Bootless Bay Over Time: Species Under Fishing Pressure")
```

## Graph: Species Free from Fishing Pressure

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(bootless_notfished_sp) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = total_catch, fill = location), position = "dodge") +
  labs(x = "Species per Genus Present by Location", y = "Frequency") +
  ggtitle("Species Richness in Bootless Bay Over Time: Species Free from Fishing Pressure")
```

## What's Behind the Trends?

* These graphs show that there is in fact slightly higher species richness in modern studies of Bootless Bay, indicated by slightly farther right bin distribution in modern counts. 

* This could be the result of indroduction of non-native species via aquarium trade or ballast water. 

* Itâ€™s also possible that the museum collection does not accurately represent the full diversity of species in Bootles Bay in 1881.
