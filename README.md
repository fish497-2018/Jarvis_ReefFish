# Jarvis_ReefFish

Analysis of data comparing the presence and absence of 470 coral reef fish species in 5 dive sites in Papua New Guinea, as well as a historical museum collection from one site (Bootless Bay)

Experimental questions: How have the species present in Bootless Bay changed over time? Does fishing pressure have any relationship to these changes?

Install and load packages "dplyr" and "ggplot2"
