# Jarvis_ReefFish

Analysis of data comparing the presence and absence of 470 coral reef fish species in 5 dive sites in Papua New Guinea, as well as a historical museum collection from one site (Bootless Bay)

Data source: https://figshare.com/articles/Species_of_coral_reef_fish_considered_in_analysis/4072587

Experimental questions: How have the species present in Bootless Bay changed over time? Does fishing pressure have any relationship to these changes?

Install and load packages "dplyr" and "ggplot2"

# Plan for Data Analysis

1. Use select() to isolate Genus, species, Bootless, Museum.Bootless, and Fished columns

2. Use filter() to create tables of species fished and not fished at Bootless
